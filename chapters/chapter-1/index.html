            <p id="para-0">When the <em>Taiyuan</em> sailed into Sydney Harbour on Thursday, 23 January
1908, there were around 50 passengers on board.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> Thirty-nine of these
were Chinese men – four bound for Sydney and six for Melbourne, with
the remainder travelling on to New Zealand, Tahiti and Fiji. James
<a class="lod-link" data-name="James Minahan" data-collection="people" property="name" href="/lodbook3/people/james-minahan/">Minahan</a> was one of those bound for Melbourne, but his name, as such, did
not appear on the passenger manifest. Instead, he was listed as ‘James
Kitchen’, aged 31, storekeeper. His race was given as ‘Chinese’ and,
under the column for nationality, it was noted that he had a birth
certificate, ‘no. 23003’. Sydney Customs Inspector <a class="lod-link" data-name="J.T.T. Donohoe" data-collection="people" property="name" href="/lodbook3/people/j-t-t-donohoe/">J.T.T. Donohoe</a> was on
the wharf to meet the <em>Taiyuan</em> and, after inspecting the passengers’
papers, he decided to give <a class="lod-link" data-name="James Minahan" data-collection="people" property="name" href="/lodbook3/people/james-minahan/">Minahan</a> the Dictation Test. This was the
passage he read:</p>

<blockquote id="quote-0">
  <p id="para-1">A large part of the cheapening of steel has been brought about by this
one device for using cheap inferior fuels. In the iron trade it was
discovered many years ago that it paid to produce more of this
particular gas than could be used in the purely metallurgical
operations.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p id="para-2"><a class="lod-link" data-name="James Minahan" data-collection="people" property="name" href="/lodbook3/people/james-minahan/">Minahan</a> was unable to complete the test, but as his ultimate destination
was Melbourne not Sydney, he was allowed to continue on with his fellow
Chinese passengers. He and the other five men were handprinted and
transhipped to the SS <em>Wollowra</em>, and they sailed at 5.30 pm on Friday,
24 January, for the final stage of their journey to Melbourne.</p>

<p id="para-3">As the men made their way south on the <em>Wollowra</em>, Donohoe advised the
Melbourne Collector of Customs and the Secretary of the Department of
External Affairs of their coming, forwarding their handprints and
documents, including <a class="lod-link" data-name="James Minahan" data-collection="people" property="name" href="/lodbook3/people/james-minahan/">Minahan</a>’s birth certificate, to assist Melbourne
Customs with the men’s identification. After the <em>Wollowra</em> arrived at
the Australian Wharf in Melbourne on Sunday, 26 January 1908, the six
men were briefly seen by Customs Officer <a class="lod-link" data-name="Hugh Mercer" data-collection="people" property="name" href="/lodbook3/people/hugh-mercer/">Hugh Mercer</a>. But, since it was
a Sunday and Mercer had no Chinese interpreter with him, he decided to
return the following day to formally examine them. Mercer returned on
Monday and, with the help of government interpreter <a class="lod-link" data-name="Harry Hoyling" data-collection="people" property="name" href="/lodbook3/people/harry-hoyling/">Harry Hoyling</a>,
interviewed <a class="lod-link" data-name="James Minahan" data-collection="people" property="name" href="/lodbook3/people/james-minahan/">Minahan</a> in the saloon of the <em>Wollowra</em>. Mercer also spoke
to ‘a reputable Chinaman’, tobacco dealer <a class="lod-link" data-name="Chan Num" data-collection="people" property="name" href="/lodbook3/people/chan-num/">Chan Num</a>, who had known
<a class="lod-link" data-name="James Minahan" data-collection="people" property="name" href="/lodbook3/people/james-minahan/">Minahan</a> as a boy and had come to meet him at the wharf. Ching Kay of Sun
Nam Hie in Little Bourke Street, another Shek Quey Lee native, also met
the boat.</p>

<p id="para-4">To execute his duties under the Immigration Restriction Act Mercer
needed to establish whether the birth certificate <a class="lod-link" data-name="James Minahan" data-collection="people" property="name" href="/lodbook3/people/james-minahan/">Minahan</a> presented was
really his own. He later noted that there was no indication on the
certificate that it belonged to someone who was ‘Chinese’. The
certificate was in the name ‘James Francis Kitchen’, no father’s name
was given and the mother was ‘Winifred <a class="lod-link" data-name="James Minahan" data-collection="people" property="name" href="/lodbook3/people/james-minahan/">Minahan</a>’. Ever alert to the
possibilities of fraud, Mercer suspected that the certificate did not
belong to this man who was Chinese in appearance and manner, and who
understood not a word of the English spoken to him. After interviewing
<a class="lod-link" data-name="James Minahan" data-collection="people" property="name" href="/lodbook3/people/james-minahan/">Minahan</a>, Mercer was not convinced of his identity and so applied the
Dictation Test. Through interpreter <a class="lod-link" data-name="Harry Hoyling" data-collection="people" property="name" href="/lodbook3/people/harry-hoyling/">Harry Hoyling</a>, Mercer told <a class="lod-link" data-name="James Minahan" data-collection="people" property="name" href="/lodbook3/people/james-minahan/">Minahan</a>
that he was going to read a passage of not less than fifty words in
English and that he was required to write them in English. He gave
<a class="lod-link" data-name="James Minahan" data-collection="people" property="name" href="/lodbook3/people/james-minahan/">Minahan</a> a pencil and paper and read a passage once slowly. It was the
same passage Donohoe had read in Sydney. When asked, <a class="lod-link" data-name="James Minahan" data-collection="people" property="name" href="/lodbook3/people/james-minahan/">Minahan</a> said that
he could not write out the passage. Mercer informed him that he was a
prohibited immigrant and that he could not land in Australia.
Consequently, <a class="lod-link" data-name="James Minahan" data-collection="people" property="name" href="/lodbook3/people/james-minahan/">Minahan</a> was to be transferred back to the <em>Taiyuan</em> in
Sydney and then returned to Hong Kong. He was not at this point formally
charged under the Immigration Restriction Act.</p>

<p id="para-5">The next day, Tuesday, <a class="lod-link" data-name="James Minahan" data-collection="people" property="name" href="/lodbook3/people/james-minahan/">Minahan</a> left Melbourne for Sydney on the
<em>Wollowra</em>, and Melbourne Customs informed their Sydney colleagues of
his rejection under the Immigration Restriction Act. When he arrived in
Sydney two days later, <a class="lod-link" data-name="James Minahan" data-collection="people" property="name" href="/lodbook3/people/james-minahan/">Minahan</a> was escorted by Inspector Donohoe back to
the <em>Taiyuan</em>, which was due to sail for Hong Kong at the end of the
following week. On Thursday, 6 February, however, two days before the
scheduled departure, the <em>Taiyuan</em>’s master, Captain Lancelot Dawson,
was asked to show cause why a writ of <em>habeas corpus</em> should not be
issued against him for holding <a class="lod-link" data-name="James Minahan" data-collection="people" property="name" href="/lodbook3/people/james-minahan/">Minahan</a> on board. <em>Habeas corpus</em> –
asking a court to decide on the lawfulness of a person’s detention –
was a tactic long used by Chinese Australians to secure the release of
those held on board ship who were facing deportation as prohibited
immigrants.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup> Only seven month earlier, for example, it had been used
successfully in the case of a youth named Willie Lee Hook, whose
situation was very similar to that of James <a class="lod-link" data-name="James Minahan" data-collection="people" property="name" href="/lodbook3/people/james-minahan/">Minahan</a>.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">4</a></sup></p>

<p id="para-6">The case against Captain Dawson was heard by Justice Philip Street of
the Supreme Court in chambers on Friday, 7 February. Barrister F.S.
Boyce acted on <a class="lod-link" data-name="James Minahan" data-collection="people" property="name" href="/lodbook3/people/james-minahan/">Minahan</a>’s behalf in the matter, under instruction from
Deane and Deane Solicitors as agents for Croft and Rhoden Solicitors of
Melbourne.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote">5</a></sup> Boyce argued that as a natural-born British subject
<a class="lod-link" data-name="James Minahan" data-collection="people" property="name" href="/lodbook3/people/james-minahan/">Minahan</a> was entitled to enter the Commonwealth, and he presented
affidavits from <a class="lod-link" data-name="James Minahan" data-collection="people" property="name" href="/lodbook3/people/james-minahan/">Minahan</a> and several Chinese residents of Victoria
attesting to the facts of <a class="lod-link" data-name="James Minahan" data-collection="people" property="name" href="/lodbook3/people/james-minahan/">Minahan</a>’s Victorian birth and subsequent
travel to China with his father. Captain Dawson argued that he was
acting on the orders of a Commonwealth Customs officer, who had declared
at that James <a class="lod-link" data-name="James Minahan" data-collection="people" property="name" href="/lodbook3/people/james-minahan/">Minahan</a> was a prohibited immigrant, noting that under
section 9 of the Immigration Restriction Act the master of a vessel was
liable for a penalty of £100 if a prohibited immigrant landed from his
vessel. On hearing the evidence, Justice Street ruled in <a class="lod-link" data-name="James Minahan" data-collection="people" property="name" href="/lodbook3/people/james-minahan/">Minahan</a>’s
favour, concluding that neither Captain Dawson nor the Commonwealth had
demonstrated that <a class="lod-link" data-name="James Minahan" data-collection="people" property="name" href="/lodbook3/people/james-minahan/">Minahan</a> was a prohibited immigrant under the Act.
Justice Street therefore ordered <a class="lod-link" data-name="James Minahan" data-collection="people" property="name" href="/lodbook3/people/james-minahan/">Minahan</a>’s release.</p>

<p id="para-7"><a class="lod-link" data-name="James Minahan" data-collection="people" property="name" href="/lodbook3/people/james-minahan/">Minahan</a> left the <em>Taiyuan</em> at around one o’clock that afternoon, but he
was not free for long. Acting on instructions from the Department of
External Affairs, Inspector Donohoe had waited at Circular Quay and
arrested <a class="lod-link" data-name="James Minahan" data-collection="people" property="name" href="/lodbook3/people/james-minahan/">Minahan</a> as he left the wharf. Donohoe took him to the No. 4
Police Station at George Street North, where he was formally charged
with being a ‘prohibited immigrant found within the Commonwealth in
contravention of the Immigration Restriction Act, 1901–1905’.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote">6</a></sup>
<a class="lod-link" data-name="James Minahan" data-collection="people" property="name" href="/lodbook3/people/james-minahan/">Minahan</a> was brought before the Water Police Court at two o’clock on
Friday, 7 February, and was remanded in custody until the following
Friday. He was held in Darlinghurst Gaol.</p>

<p id="para-8">On 6 February, when Captain Dawson had been summonsed to appear before
Justice Street, the Collector of Customs in Sydney had sent an urgent
telegram to the Department of External Affairs in Melbourne for advice
on what action to take. The Secretary, Atlee Hunt, had responded, also
by telegram:</p>

<blockquote id="quote-1">
  <p id="para-9">Take no action in Kitchens case … so far as habeas proceedings are
concerned presume he will be brought before Court and his discharge
ordered … if that happens he should be arrested on leaving Court and
charged with being prohibited immigrant &amp; on appearance before police
court remand should be applied for to allow Crown solicitor to be
instructed.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote">7</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p id="para-10">Hunt also received a personal letter from <a class="lod-link" data-name="James Minahan" data-collection="people" property="name" href="/lodbook3/people/james-minahan/">Minahan</a>’s Melbourne solicitor,
E.A. Fortescue Croft, sent from Sydney the same day.</p>

<p id="para-11">When <a class="lod-link" data-name="James Minahan" data-collection="people" property="name" href="/lodbook3/people/james-minahan/">Minahan</a> was rejected at Melbourne and returned to Sydney, Croft had
rushed north to start legal proceedings on his behalf. Although there is
no certain evidence in the archives, it is likely that it was <a class="lod-link" data-name="James Minahan" data-collection="people" property="name" href="/lodbook3/people/james-minahan/">Minahan</a>’s
uncles in Melbourne, Ah Doe and Ah Yuey, who organised and paid for this
legal representation. Another possibility is that it was done through
the auspices of the Kong Chew Society (岡州會館) or the See Yup Society
(四邑會館), welfare and mutual aid societies established in Melbourne in
the 1850s for people from Sunwui county and the See Yup or Four Counties
district, of which Sunwui was a part.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote">8</a></sup> Croft was a sensible choice of
solicitor, as he already had experience in representing Chinese
Australians in their legal struggles against the Commonwealth and
continued to do so in following years.<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote">9</a></sup></p>

<p id="para-12">In his private letter to Hunt, Croft wrote that he had ‘not managed the
High Court Habeas after all’ and so had ‘taken your middle course here
by issuing an order nisi calling on the captain to shew cause why a writ
of habeas corpus should not issue’. Croft had been advised by the
Commonwealth’s counsel that this was ‘the Sydney practice’. He updated
Hunt on the progress of the case and urged him to ‘take this private
letter in the spirit it is sent’, noting ‘you see I always try to fight
straight.’<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote">10</a></sup></p>

<p id="para-13">These private discussions between <a class="lod-link" data-name="James Minahan" data-collection="people" property="name" href="/lodbook3/people/james-minahan/">Minahan</a>’s solicitor and those
representing the Commonwealth were the beginning of a course of action,
engineered behind the scenes, that eventually saw the case transferred
from Sydney to Melbourne. The Department of External Affairs first
passed the matter to the Crown Solicitor and, on request, Inspector
Donohoe sent his file to the Crown Solicitor’s Sydney office. Then moves
were taken for Melbourne Customs Officer <a class="lod-link" data-name="Hugh Mercer" data-collection="people" property="name" href="/lodbook3/people/hugh-mercer/">Hugh Mercer</a> and Chinese
interpreter <a class="lod-link" data-name="Harry Hoyling" data-collection="people" property="name" href="/lodbook3/people/harry-hoyling/">Harry Hoyling</a> to journey to Sydney for the hearing against
James <a class="lod-link" data-name="James Minahan" data-collection="people" property="name" href="/lodbook3/people/james-minahan/">Minahan</a> on Friday, 14 February. However, realising the difficulty
and expense of defending his client in Sydney, where he had no friends
or contacts, Croft wrote to Atlee Hunt suggesting that the case be
transferred to Melbourne. Hunt advised the Crown Solicitor on 11
February that ‘the Department has no particular wish to act either for
or against Mr Croft’s desires and will accept your decision which will
doubtless be in accord with the general balance of convenience’.<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote">11</a></sup>
Croft and the Crown Solicitor soon came to an agreement which suited all
parties.</p>
